[00:00.22] Some day, some day
[00:05.57] Some day I'll, I will wear a starry crown
[00:26.07] 
[00:13.21] Some day, some day
[00:16.23] Some day
[00:17.92] I wanna lay down
[00:20.53] Like God did, on Sunday
[00:23.41] Hold up, hold up
[00:24.74] Some days, some days
[00:27.78] I remember this on some days
[00:30.70] Back way, yeah way, way
[00:33.18] Some day, mmm, mmm
[00:42.18] 
[00:37.28] Some day
[00:39.75] I wanna tell everybody
[00:42.34] Some days
[00:45.19] I wanna hit the red dot, I'll never find
[00:48.14] Some days, some
[00:52.41] Smokin' marijuana
[00:55.19] Now I'm livin' high, doin' what I wanna someday
[01:18.69] 
[00:59.55] I've been tryin' to make you love me
[01:11.02] But everything I try just takes you further from me
[01:36.52] 
[01:22.32] Some day we gon' set it off
[01:26.04] Some day we gon' get this off
[01:28.78] Baby, don't you bet it all
[01:31.74] On a pack of Fentanyl
[01:34.68] You might think they wrote you off
[01:37.54] They gon' have to rope me off
[01:40.34] Some day the drama'll be gone
[01:43.29] And they'll pray . no, oh, no
[01:46.39] Sometimes I take all the shine
[01:48.95] Talk like I drank all the wine
[01:51.74] Years ahead but way behind
[01:54.61] I'm on one, two, three, four, five
[01:57.63] No half-truths, just naked minds
[02:00.66] Caught between space and time
[02:03.45] This now, with good in mind
[02:06.35] But maybe some day
[02:15.35] 
[02:09.00] I've been tryin' to make you love me
[02:19.96] But everything I try just takes you further from me
[02:30.80] I've been tryin' to make you love me
[02:31.50] But everything I try just takes you further from me
[02:57.00] 
[02:32.96] Oh, once again I am a child
[02:37.88] I let it all go, of everything that I know, yeah
[02:46.57] Of everything that I know, yeah
[02:49.92] And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
[02:57.02] We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
[03:04.17] I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed
[03:28.67] 
[03:12.66] Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
[03:19.94] We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
[03:27.06] I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed
[03:35.51] Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
[03:43.06] We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
[03:50.08] I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed
[03:58.76] Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
[04:06.15] We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
[04:13.23] I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed
[04:21.74] Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
